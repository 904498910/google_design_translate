# Subheaders

Subheaders are special list tiles that delineate distinct sections of a list or grid list and are typically related to the current filtering or sorting criteria. Subheader tiles are either displayed inline with tiles or can be associated with content, for example, in an adjacent column. Upon scrolling, subheaders remain pinned to the top of the screen and remain pinned until pushed on or off screen by the next subheader. To improve the visual grouping of content, use the system color for your subheaders.

## List Subheaders

Tile height is 48 dp

Subheader font: Roboto Medium 14sp

A subheader should be left- aligned with an avatar/icon in a list, unless there is a promoted action in that space.

If there is a promoted action left- aligned with the avatar/icon in a list, align the subheader with the text content.
