Floating Action Button

Floating action buttons are a special case of promoted actions. They are distinguished by a circled icon floating above the UI and have special motion behaviors, related to morphing, launching, and its transferring anchor point.

There are two sizes of floating action buttons: the default size and the mini, which should only be used to create visual continuity with other elements on the screen.

Not every screen needs a floating action button. A floating action button should represent the primary action in an application. In the screen on the left, the primary action is to touch and open images in a gallery, so no floating action button is needed. On the right, the primary action is to add files. A floating action buton is appropriate.
