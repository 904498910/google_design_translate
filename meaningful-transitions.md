有意義的漸進過程
有時候使用者不易專注於應用程式本身，或迷失於a到b的過程
It can sometimes be difficult for a user to know where to focus their attention in an app or how an app element got from point A to point B. 
Carefully choreographed motion design can effectively guide the user’s attention and focus through multiple steps of a process or procedure; avoid confusion when layouts change or elements are rearranged; and improve the overall beauty of the experience. Motion design should not only be beautiful, but serve a functional purpose.

連續的視流

兩個不同狀態的視覺漸變必須是流暢而輕鬆的。
最重要的是讓使用者更清晰而非困惑。
設計良好的漸變動畫，

Transitioning between two visual states should be smooth, appear effortless, and above all, provide clarity to the user, not confusion. A well-designed transition does the heavy lifting and enables the user to clearly understand where their attention should be focused. 

漸變動畫的範疇包含三個元素：

> 進入的元素。可能是直接新增的元素或從其他位置轉變過來的，這些元素有各自被引進或再製造的方式。
> 離開的元素。與新內容不再相關的元素必須透過適當的方式移除。
> 存留元素。從漸變動畫開始到結束都持續存在的元素，可能是細小的icon圖示或顯眼的大型圖片，透過動畫改變成符合螢幕的尺寸。




注意

當你在設計你的動畫時，請注意以下幾件事：
> 思考使用者的注意力應該如何被引導？什麼元素或動作能夠支持這個目標？
> 動畫過程中，要進入、離開或共用的元素，要如何安排強調或弱化？
> 設計畫面時，思考動畫前後的狀態，找出機會創造色彩上或存留元素的視覺關聯性。
> 審慎地加入動作：思考如何透過移動一個元素，使動畫漸變的過程更加清晰流暢。






你該這麼做：
Layer paper where appropriate. In general, incoming paper elements may slide into view, but ink elements don’t; they should fade in. Fullscreen cross-fades are not desirable, but are preferred over cuts.



不要這麼做：
Avoid hard cuts. Hard cuts are jarring and make the user work too hard to understand the transition.








Hierarchical Timing

When building a transition, consider both the order in which elements move and the timing of their movement. Ensure that motion supports the information hierarchy; that is, it conveys to the user what content is most important by creating a path for the eye to follow.

However, it’s not a simple formula in which the most important thing moves first and the least important last. The timing of transition elements should flow smoothly and avoid feeling disjointed.



Examples

你該這麼做：
使用重疊的動線引導使用者的注意力。
Use overlapping motion to direct user attention.

不要這麼做：
Concurrent timing for all elements provides no indication of what is important. If all elements have equal importance, consider larger-scale motion to introduce them as a group.





Consistent Choreography
動畫元素在畫面中移動時應該要有順序的安排
元素移動的路徑必須合理且有次序。

As transitioning elements move around the screen, they should behave in a coordinated manner. 
The paths elements travel along should all make sense and be orderly. 
Haphazard motion is distracting. A well-choreographed app also provides teachable moments for the user. When transitioning elements are coordinated, the user’s understanding of the app grows. They “get” the app; they don’t feel disoriented by the animation.



最佳典範

避免線性
> Avoid linear spatial paths, except when movement is constrained to an axis or moving towards/away from a specific point in concert with other elements.
> Make sure that the direction in which elements move is cohesive across the transition. Avoid conflicting movements and overlapping paths.
> Consider the depth story: what moves under what, and why?
> If all moving elements traced their paths on screen, would it look beautiful and organized? Does it create a clear picture of where to look?
> Support spatial relationships through consistent motions for incoming and outgoing elements.



 
你該這麼做：
使用協調且俱有順序性的動線指引使用者的注意力。



不要這麼做：
避免使用無連續性或無順序性的動線，物件進出時也要避免看似隨機的出入動線。
