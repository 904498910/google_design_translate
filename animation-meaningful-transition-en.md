# Meaningful Transitions

It can sometimes be difficult for a user to know where to focus their attention in an app or how an app element got from point A to point B. Carefully choreographed motion design can effectively guide the user’s attention and focus through multiple steps of a process or procedure; avoid confusion when layouts change or elements are rearranged; and improve the overall beauty of the experience. Motion design should not only be beautiful, but serve a functional purpose.

## Visual Continuity

Transitioning between two visual states should be smooth, appear effortless, and above all, provide clarity to the user, not confusion. A well-designed transition does the heavy lifting and enables the user to clearly understand where their attention should be focused. A transition has three categories of elements:

- **Incoming elements.** Whether newly generated or translated into the scene, these items need to be introduced or re-established.
- **Outgoing elements.** Elements that are no longer relevant to the new context must be removed from the scene in an appropriate manner.
- **Shared elements.** Elements that persist from the starting to the ending state of a transition. They can be as subtle as a single icon or as dominant as a gallery image that grows to fit the screen.


### Considerations

When you design your animations, consider the following:

- Think about how the users attention should be directed. What elements and motions support that goal? How should incoming, outgoing, and shared elements be emphasized or de-emphasized through the transition?
- Consider transitions when designing screens and find opportunities to create visual connections between transition states through color and persisting elements.
- Add motion judiciously: consider how moving a certain element adds clarity and delight to a transition.

## Hierarchical Timing

When building a transition, consider both the order in which elements move and the timing of their movement. Ensure that motion supports the information hierarchy; that is, it conveys to the user what content is most important by creating a path for the eye to follow.

However, it’s not a simple formula in which the most important thing moves first and the least important last. The timing of transition elements should flow smoothly and avoid feeling disjointed.

> Don't.

> Concurrent timing for all elements provides no indication of what is important. If all elements have equal importance, consider larger-scale motion to introduce them as a group.

## Consistent Choreography

As transitioning elements move around the screen, they should behave in a coordinated manner. The paths elements travel along should all make sense and be orderly. Haphazard motion is distracting. A well-choreographed app also provides teachable moments for the user. When transitioning elements are coordinated, the user’s understanding of the app grows. They “get” the app; they don’t feel disoriented by the animation.

### Best Practices

- Avoid linear spatial paths, except when movement is constrained to an axis or moving towards/away from a specific point in concert with other elements.
- Make sure that the direction in which elements move is cohesive across the transition. Avoid conflicting movements and overlapping paths.
- Consider the depth story: what moves under what, and why?
- If all moving elements traced their paths on screen, would it look beautiful and organized? Does it create a clear picture of where to look?
- Support spatial relationships through consistent motions for incoming and outgoing elements.
