# Principles

Material design utilizes fundamental tools that have come from the world of print design, like baseline grids and a common set of structural grids that works across various pages. The layout is designed to scale across different screen sizes and will help facilitate UI development and ultimately help you make scalable apps.

The layout guidelines also encourage apps to have a consistent look and feel by using the same visual elements, structural grids, and general spacing rules across platforms and screen sizes. Structural and visual consistency creates an environment for the user that is recognizable across products, which facilitates usage by providing users with a high level of familiarity and comfort.

Before delving into layout details, consider again what material design is: a design based on the qualities of paper. Understanding the rules of how paper behaves and is crafted is important.

## Paper Craft

**In material design, every pixel drawn by an application resides on a sheet of paper.** Paper has a flat background color and can be sized to serve a variety of purposes. A typical layout is composed of multiple sheets of paper.

The system may draw pixels for elements such as status or system bars, which don’t reside on paper. It’s helpful to think of such system elements as being printed on the back side of the display’s glass, on a surface that is separate from the app content beneath.

### Arranging Paper

**Seams** are created when two sheets of paper share the full length of a common side. Two sheets of paper joined by a seam will generally move together.

**Steps** are created when two sheets of paper with different z-order positions overlap and thus typically move independently of each other.

### Paper Toolbars

A **toolbar** is a strip of paper focused on presenting actions. These actions usually cluster at the left and right edges of the toolbar. Actions related to navigation (a drawer menu, an up arrow) appear at the left, while actions that apply to the current context are at the right.
