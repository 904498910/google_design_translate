# Imagery

![](/images/style/style-imagery-style_philosophy_large_xhdpi.png)

In material design, imagery—whether illustration or photography—is constructed but never contrived, magical but never overproduced. The style is optimistic, delightful and honest. Materiality, texture, depth, unexpected use of color, and appreciation of context are emphasized. The principles of imagery support the goal of purposeful, thoughtful, beautiful UIs.

## Principles

When using illustration and photography to enhance the user experience, choose images that express personal relevance, information and delight.

> **Personal Relevance**
>
> Use evocative imagery that establishes an emotional connection with the app.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-principles-information_large_xhdpi.png)

> **Information**
> Convey specific information. Facilitate comprehension to create an experience that feels intelligent.

> **Delight**
>
> Delight the user with unexpected but relevant imagery to make the experience feel magical.

### Appreciation of context

Incorporate logic to ensure images are dynamic, context-intelligent, and context-relevant. Predictive visuals display a level of intelligence that substantially improves the user experience.

### Be Immersive

Don’t be afraid of obscuring or alluding to integrated heros and thumbnails through color and content overlays.

## Best Practices

### Use Multiple Mediums

Both illustration and photography can live within the same product. Photography automatically implies a degree of specificity and should be used to showcase specific entities and stories. Illustration is effective for representing concepts and metaphors where specific photography might be alienating.

> 
> For specific entities, look first to photographic representation.

> Do.
> 
> When total specificity is not available or applicable, illustration conveys your app's intelligence while allowing at-a-glance comprehension of content.

> Do.
>
> If you use photography to convey a concept, develop considered, even metaphorical, pieces.

> Don't.
>
> Don't default to literal stock photography.

### Stay away from stock

Use imagery to express a distinctive voice and exemplify creative excellence.

For specific entities or branded content, use specific imagery. For more abstract content, be interpretive. Photographic stock and clipart is neither specific nor interpretive.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-stock-do_large_xhdpi.png)

> Do.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-stock-dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Don't

### Have a point of focus

Have an iconic point of focus in your imagery. Focus ranges from a single entity to an overarching composition. Ensure that a clear concept is conveyed to the user in a memorable way.

> Do.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-point-focus-reminder-dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Don't

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-point-focus-sf-do_large_xhdpi.png)

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-point-focus-sf-dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Do.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-point-focus-flight-dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Don't.

### Build narratives

Create an immersive story and a sense of context.

> Do.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-narrative-appointment-dont_large_xhdpi.png)

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-narrative-carseat-do_large_xhdpi.png)

> Do

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-narrative-carseat-dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Don't.


### Don't Over-Manipulate

Maintain the original integrity of the image. Don’t apply heavy filters or gaussian blurs to imagery, especially when trying to hide degradation.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-manipulate-flowers-do_large_xhdpi.png)

> Do.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-manipulate-flowers-dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Don't

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-manipulate-lake-do_large_xhdpi.png)

> Do.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-bestpractices-manipulate-lake-dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Don't

## UI Integration

### Resolution

Make sure your images are appropriately sized for their containers and across platforms. The framework emphasizes large images. Ideally, the assets should not appear pixelated. Test appropriate resolution sizes for specific ratios and devices.


![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-resolutiona_large_xhdpi.png)

> Do.
>
> Appropriately sized imagery

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-resolutionb_large_xhdpi.png)


> Don't.
> 
> Degraded imagery

### Introduce Scale

Introduce alternative scales to create levels of visual importance.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-introduce_scalea_large_xhdpi.png)

> Within a gallery context, introduce thumbnails of various sizes to convey content hierarchy.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-introduce_scaleb_large_xhdpi.png)

> Encourage multiple containers living in the same ecosystem.

### Text Protection

To make typography legible on imagery, add text protection scrims.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-typetreatment1do_large_xhdpi.png)

> Do.
>
> Dark scrims should ideally be between 20%-40% opacity depending on the content. Light scrims should ideally range from 40%-60% opacity depending on the content.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-typetreatment1dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Don't
> 
> Don't heavily obscure imagery with text protection scrims.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-typetreatment2do_large_xhdpi.png)


> Do.
>
> For larger real estate, target specific areas for text protection instead of blanketing the entire image.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-typetreatment2dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Don't.
>
> Don’t "over-scrim" large images.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-typetreatment3do_large_xhdpi.png)

> Do.
>
> Color overlays are different than text-protection scrims and can be used as a design element. When creating complementary color overlays, color-sample from the juxtaposed content to create a unified palette and show content awareness.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-typetreatment3dont_large_xhdpi.png)

> Don't

### Avatars and Thumbnails

Avatars and thumbnails represent entities or content, either literally through photography or conceptually through illustration. Generally, they are tap targets that lead to a primary view of the entity or content.

Avatars can be used to represent people. For personal avatars, offer personalization options. As users may choose not to personalize an avatar, provide delightful defaults. When used with a specific logo, avatars can also be used to represent brand.

Thumbnails allude to more information—letting the user peek into content—and assist navigation. Thumbnails let you include imagery in tight spaces.

> Avatars make an app feel more personal—and occupy minimal space.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-imagetypeavatarsb_large_xhdpi.png)

> A brand avatar communicates information at a glance, as does the thumbnail image.

### Hero Images

Hero images are images that are usually anchored in a prominent position, above the fold, such as a banner at the top of the screen. They serve to draw in a user, provide context about the content, or reinforce brand.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-imagetypeheroa_large_xhdpi.png)

> **Feature image**
>
> A feature image is a bold, primary point of focus within a heterogeneous layout.

![](/images/style/style-imagery-integration-imagetypeherob_large_xhdpi.png)

> **Integrated hero image**
>
> Integrated hero images create a setting for heterogeneous pieces of content within a layout. They are not the primary points of focus.

### Gallery

Gallery images are bold visual hero images within homogeneous layouts in either a grid or as a single image.
